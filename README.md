# AML-CSV-data
This has acute myeloid leukemia patient input data that can be used for machine learning

## About this data:
This data contains 'metadata' from patients who have Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This is a cancer that affects the bonemarrow and blood cells, the cells themselves are mutated and prevent oxygen from binding properly.
The data is provided from an AML prediction challenged intended to be used with machine learning models, as it comes with training and testing data.
This data includes genomic data to help with predictions, in the case certain expression of genes may help predict an outcome.
Imputation may be required as the data may have n.a. or missing data.
The data is provided in .csv format, that can be collected with Pandas or any other choice of library to read such data.
